[Verse 1]

 

          D              A
Come thou fount of every blessing
D/F#    G        A        D
Tune my heart to sing thy grace
           Bm          A
Streams of mercy never ceasing
D/F#     G        A       D
Call for songs of loudest praise
         Bm             D
Teach me some melodious sonnet
        G       A        Bm
Sung by flaming tongues above
           D                A
Praise the mount I'm fixed upon it
D        G      A      D
Mount of thy redeeming love


[Verse 2]
       D            A
Here I raise my Ebenezer
D/F#    G         A         D
Here by Thy great help I’ve come;
      Bm           A
And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
D/F#   G         A  D
Safely to arrive at home
       Bm              D
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
       G           A       Bm
Wand’ring from the fold of God;
      D              A
He to rescue me from danger
D     G    A       D
interposed his precious blood

[Verse 3]
     D                  A
O to grace how great a debtor
D/F#   G      A          D
Daily I'm constrained to be
        Bm                A
Let thy goodness, like a fetter
D/F#    G         A        D
Bind my wandering heart to thee
          Bm             D
Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it
         G         A     Bm
Prone to leave the God I love
          D                 A
Here's my heart, O take and seal it,
D       G        A      D
Seal it for thy courts above

[Verse 4]
