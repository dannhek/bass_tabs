[Verse 1]

D                    G     D
Before the throne of God above,
D                          F#m
I have a strong, a perfect plea,
  D            G     D      A       Bm
A great High Priest whose name is "Love,"
         G          Em    G   D
Who ever lives and pleads for me.

[Chorus 1]
        F#m G D            A
My name is graven on His hands,
D      F#m  G  D    G  A    Bm
My name is written on His heart;
  Bm          G   D     A       Bm2
I know that while in heav'n He stands
Bm            G      Em     G    Bm
no tongue can bid me thence depart.
   Bm          G     Em     G    D
No tongue can bid me thence depart.

[Verse 2]
D                    G  D
When Satan tempts me to despair,
D                   F#m
and tells me of the guilt within,
  D      G     D  A       Bm
upward I look and see Him there
         G          Em G  D
Who made an end to all my sin.

[Chorus 2]
        F#m G D            A
Because the sinless Saviour died,
D    F#m  G    D  G  A    Bm
my sinful soul is counted free;
  Bm          G   D     A       Bm2
For God, the Just, is satisfied
Bm            G      Em     G    Bm
to look on him and pardon me.
   Bm          G     Em     G    D
to look on him and pardon me.

[Verse 3]
D                    G  D
Behold him there! the risen Lamb,
D                   F#m
my perfect, spotless Righteousness,
  D      G     D  A       Bm
the great unchangeable I AM,
         G          Em G  D
the King of glory and of grace!

 

 

[Chorus 3]
        F#m G D            A
One with Himself I cannot die,
D    F#m  G    D  G  A    Bm
My soul is purchased by His blood;
  Bm          G   D     A       Bm2
My life is hid with Christ on high,
Bm            G      Em     G    Bm
with Christ, my Saviour and my God
   Bm          G     Em     G    D
with Christ, my Saviour and my God
