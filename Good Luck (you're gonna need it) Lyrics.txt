G                   (D)
Good Luck           You're gonna need it
G                   D
Life's a bitch and  she'll deceive ya 
A                               C/B
so take your hot air balloon    up to Mariana's Trench 
G                               D 
and let the weight of it all    keep pushing you higher 
A                               C/B 
Until you fall back down        into the exosphere 
G 
just to see what's next 


Verse 1 
G
Grew up in posh suburbia 
C
listening to bands that made it almost bearable 
A 
when I knew that I'd had enough 
D 
I let my six-string make my fingers bleed 

Pre-Chorus 
D.....
And the strings said...

Chorus 

Verse 2 
G
studied hard but got no where  
C
until I did and then I climbed the ladder  
A 
nights and weekends and losing hair  
D 
so I traded my paycheck for grad school 

Pre-Chorus 
D.....
And the books said...

Chorus 

Verse 3 
G
overwhelmed but moving onward
C
only me between myself and the stars 
A 
still unsure of all the places I'll go  
D 
so I'll call up lady fortuna 

Pre-Chorus 
D.....
And then she'll say...

Chorus

Outro (the chorus with new words)
G                   (D)
Good Luck           You're gonna get this
G                   D
Life's a bitch but  she'll surprise ya 
A                               C/B
so with a friend at your side   you'll climb to the peak 
G                               D 
and let the thinness of air     keep pushing you higher 
A                               C/B 
Until you shoot for the moon    and bathe in the stars 
G 
just to see what's next
